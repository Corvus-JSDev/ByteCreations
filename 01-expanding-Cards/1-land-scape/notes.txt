Build a site that has 5 imgs that are condensed by default except for the first one

When the user clicks on an img that will set that imgs class to 'active' and will smoothly transition into that img

The tag or name of the img will only come in after the img is full expanded


== Process plan

// get 5 imgs

// line up those imgs in rows

// put a crop on them all so they all have the same aspect ratio

// apply css to scale them down horizontally

// make a class called 'active' and have that class take up the full available space

// write some js to change the clicked img into the one that expands

// after the img is fully expanded, show to text



== Problems

the scaling system. flex was not the easiest to use and i still have no idea how it works

the transition. i needed to make a div look like an img by putting the img as its background. i don't know what using the <img> tag wasn't working but of fucking well.

the text delay. apparently the 4th element of the transition property is for delay
